    "Awesome job.  You were able to perform very useful analyses and create great visuals representing crime in NY City.  The line chart representing total number of crimes reported by year helped you to determine whether there were any trends in the number of crimes reported.  Understanding these trends might give you insight on whether new policing methods are working.  An increasing trend, for example, might result in a recommendation of implementing different policing methods as the ones currently in place are not decreasing crime.\n",

Recognizing seasonal patterns could give you insight on what months to increase/decrease police presence in the city.  A finding of more crime, for example, in the summer months might result in a recommendation of more police officers patrolling the city during that time.  \n",
