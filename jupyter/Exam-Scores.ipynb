    "Very cool.  You were able to create great visuals representing exam results of the standardized test.  The histogram allowed you to see the frequency of students scoring within predefined ranges.  Therefore, you could easily find the ranges where the most and least students scored.  The boxplot displayed the distributional characteristics of the exam result data.  You were able to use it to approximate the dataâ€™s statistical properties visually.  Results from these charts allowed you to see how well students at the school performed on the exam.\n",
